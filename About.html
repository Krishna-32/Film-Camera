            <p>A film camera, also known as an analog camera, is a traditional photographic device that captures images on photographic film.<br><br> Unlike digital cameras, film cameras use rolls of light-sensitive film to record pictures. <br><br> When you take a photo with a film camera, light enters through the camera's lens and exposes the film,<br><br>creating a latent image. To view the photographs, the film must be developed in a darkroom or by a professional lab,<br> <br>a process that involves chemical development, fixing, and printing.<br><br> Film cameras are renowned for their unique and timeless aesthetic, offering a hands-on and nostalgic approach to photography,<br><br> with each shot requiring careful consideration and precision.<br><br> While digital photography has become more prevalent, film cameras continue to be cherished by enthusiasts and artists for their<br><br> ability to capture the world in an authentic and tangible way, preserving the art of analog photography.</p>
